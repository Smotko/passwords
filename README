How to get the site working on your localhost?

You'll need python + django and an SQL database

run "git clone git@github.com:Smotko/passwords.git"
edit settings.py and configure your database, run "python manage.py syncdb" -- this will create the needed tables in your db
run "python manage.py runserver" and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/
Have fun :)

IMPORTANT:
The password field in web_password table should use utf8_bin encoding
(or something similar if your not using MySQL). There is no way to set this
with django so you'll have to alter the field by hand...
